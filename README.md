# Welcome
This repository contains the source code of the Progress NativeScript UI samples application. The repository does not contain the source code of UI for NativeScript itself but rather uses the npm package `nativescript-pro-ui` [![npm](https://img.shields.io/npm/v/nativescript-pro-ui.svg)](https://www.npmjs.com/package/nativescript-pro-ui).

The `master` branch contains code currently under development and is not meant to be used with the officially released version of NativeScript UI.

The `release` branch is the default one and is tested with the latest NativeScript UI version available.

## Overview
Progress NativeScript UI samples app resides in the **sdk** folder at root repository level. The folder has a standard NativeScript application structure as described in [this article](http://docs.nativescript.org/getting-started#directory-structure). The source code of the samples resides in the folders named after each component available in **Progress NativeScript UI**. The currently available components are:

- Calendar
- Chart
- DataForm
- Feedback
- ListView
- SideDrawer
- Gauges
- AutoCompleteTextView
