# Welcome
This repository contains the source code of the UI for NativeScript samples application. The repository does not contain the source code of UI for NativeScript itself.

The `master` branch contains code currently under development and is not meant to be used with the officially released version of NativeScript UI.

The `release` branch is the default one and is tested with the latest NativeScript UI version available.

##Overview
The UI for NativeScript samples app resides in the **sdk** folder at root repository level. The folder has a standard NativeScript application structure as described in [this article](http://docs.nativescript.org/getting-started#directory-structure). The source code of the samples resides in the folders named after each component available in **UI for NativeScript**. The currently available components are:

- chart
- sidedrawer
- listview
- calendar

## Running **UI for NativeScript** sample app
Make sure you are using NativeScript 1.6+. To see which version of NativeScript you are currently using, type `tns --version` in the console. Also you will need the latest version of [typescript](http://www.typescriptlang.org/Tutorial) (`tsc`) installed so that you can transpile the ts files before running the app.

Steps to run the sample:

1. `git clone https://github.com/telerik/nativescript-ui-samples.git`
2. `cd nativescript-ui-samples/sdk/app`
3. `tsc // this is to compile the typescript files. The compiler is going to report a lot of errors, but ignore them.` 
4. `tns run android` or `tns emulate ios`
