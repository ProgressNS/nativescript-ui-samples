# Welcome
This repository contains the source code of the Progress NativeScript UI samples application. The repository does not contain the source code of UI for NativeScript itself but rather uses the npm package of `nativescript-telerik-ui-pro` [![npm](https://img.shields.io/npm/v/nativescript-telerik-ui-pro.svg)](https://www.npmjs.com/package/nativescript-telerik-ui-pro) or `nativescript-telerik-ui` [![npm](https://img.shields.io/npm/v/nativescript-telerik-ui.svg)](https://www.npmjs.com/package/nativescript-telerik-ui).

The `master` branch contains code currently under development and is not meant to be used with the officially released version of NativeScript UI.

The `release` branch is the default one and is tested with the latest NativeScript UI version available.
