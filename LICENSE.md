1. Definitions
For purposes of this Agreement:

“Integrated Products” means Your proprietary software applications which: (i) are developed by Your Licensed Developers; (ii) add substantial functionality beyond the functionality provided by the incorporated components of the Programs; and (iii) are not commercial alternatives for, or competitive in the marketplace with, the Programs or any components of the Programs.

“Licensed Developers” means Your employees or third-party contractors authorized to develop software specifically for You using the Software in accordance with this Agreement. 

2. Software License

2.1 License Grant. Subject to the terms and conditions set forth in this Agreement, Telerik hereby grants to Licensee and Licensee hereby accepts, a limited, non-transferable, perpetual, sublicenseable (solely as set forth in Section 2.3), non-exclusive license (the “License”) to use the Telerik computer software identified as Progress NativeScript UI and any updates, upgrades, modifications and error corrections thereto provided to Licensee (the “Programs”) and any accompanying documentation (the “Documentation”, together with the Programs, collectively the “Software”) solely as specified in this Agreement. You are granted a Developer License pursuant to Section 2.4. 

2.2 Scope of Use. The Software is licensed, not sold, on a per-seat basis.

The Software is in “use” on a computer when it is loaded into temporary memory (i.e. RAM) or installed into permanent memory (e.g. hard disk or other storage device). Your Licensed Developers may install the Software on multiple machines, so long as the Software is not being used simultaneously for development purposes at any given time by more Licensed Developers than You have License seats. You are not limited by the number of License seats with respect to how many individuals within Your organization may access and use the Software for testing and building purposes. You may also embed copies of the Programs in Your Integrated Products that You license and distribute to Your own end-user licensees, including but not limited to, Your employees (“Authorized End-Users”), solely in accordance with the requirements set forth in Section 2.3 below.

Notwithstanding subsection 2.3.1(iii), if Your Integrated Product is only distributed to Your employees for internal use, You are not required to distribute Your Integrated Product pursuant to an end user license agreement or terms of use. In no event are You allowed to distribute the Software or sublicense its use (a) in any format other than in object form, (b) as a standalone product or (c) as a part of any product other than Your Integrated Product.

2.3.2.2 You must ensure that the Software is not distributed in any form that allows it to be reused by any application other than Your Integrated Product.
